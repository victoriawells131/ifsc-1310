  <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignemnt</h2>
  <p>Working on this project I truly got to see how HTML 
  and CSS are used in action to create websites. I've never 
  done anything like this before, so it's been a challenge to keep up. 
  Yet, I can definetly say that I am taking a lot of thing away from this class
  for future use. As well as that I do have an idea of how to format HTML.</p>
  <p> Some things I would do differently if I could start over
  would be to take more written notes; HTML is a lot of knowlegde 
  and it's not something you can just remember. You have to get into the practice of it.
  I would take the time to pay extra attention to CSS unit since I found myself 
  struggling with that part. Finally, I would ask more questions 
 because this is a learning process.

  <h2>Dragon Project Reflection</h2>
  <p>If I'm being honest I struggled with this specific project 
  quite a lot (mostly because I didn't give myself time to work on this). So when I showed 
  someone what I had originally their first comment
  was that it was plain. So I tried to add a brighter color to my color scheme.
  With HTML it's basically like a sandbox 
  when you're creating something. There's so many options for 
  color schemes and fonts and formatting. I'm the type of person that 
  likes limitations and that's something I'll have to grow out of. Building a website is something 
  that needs to be planned out. If I could start over I would draw out 
  the format I was thinking of. There are many things I could have done better 
  and in the future I hope to of taken what I've learned from this class and not make the same mistakes.</p>
